This is actually just an early prototype cooked up in bout 2 days but the video controls here has been in development for a while but just needs some field testing and they will be used in the real offline player so do well to give feedback, report bugs, request features or just criticize by sending me a mail. It is currently a single page website with a HTML5 custom
